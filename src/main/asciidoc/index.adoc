Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`CategoryControllerTest` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three documentation snippets.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/api/v1/categories/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/api/v1/categories/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/api/v1/categories/http-response.adoc[]

Response Body:
include::{snippets}/api/v1/categories/response-body.adoc[]

Response Fields:
